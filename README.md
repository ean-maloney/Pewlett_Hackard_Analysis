# Pewlett Hackard Retirement Analysis

## Overview
The first purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of employees (by position) whose ages fall inside the established "ready to retire" range. This range presently includes birth dates between 1952 and 1955, and it is presumed that employees whose birth dates fall within this range will retire in the near future. 

The second purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of employees (by position) who would be eligible for a proposed mentorship program in which senior employees would transition into a part-time role where they would help train newly hired employees. The baseline criteria given for this analysis was that eligible employees would be those born in the year 1965.

## Results
Some key findings of this anaylsis:
  - Across all positions, there are 90,398 employees currently in the "ready to retire" range.
  - Across all positions, there are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.
  - There are two managers in the "ready to retire" range, and none that are eligible for the             mentorship program.
  - The ratios of retiring employees to eligible mentors by position are approximately as follows:
  
    Assistant Engineer 41:1
    
    Engineer 47:1
    
    Senior Engineer 73:1
    
    Senior Staff 101:1
    
    Staff 28:1
    
    Technique Leader 58:1
 
 Below are tables for the numbers of retiring and mentorship eligible employees by position.

## Summary
This report has found that over 90,000 employees will likely be retiring in the near future, and that, given the number of eligible mentors, any mentorship program would have to pair many new employees with mentors. Moreover, this assumes that a high percentage of eligible employees would agree to become mentors. This suggests that there may not be enough mentors available to successfully implement a mentorship program for all newly-hired employees.
